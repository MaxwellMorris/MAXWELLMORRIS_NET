I know I am not a great writer but I do intend to become better. It is my intention that for the next year as I work on my honours thesis I will continually post my work and progress on this website as a way to keep myself in check and improve my writing. I am not sure how other people go about there research work but for me I think me maintaining this website will be good for me.
